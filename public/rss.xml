&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum began as scrambled, nonsensical Latin derived from Cicero’s 1st-century BC text De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rafaelangical&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rafaelangical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a nonsense text. “It’s not Latin, though it looks like it, and it actually says nothing,” Before &amp;#x26; After magazine answered a curious reader, “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Cicero would put it, “Um, not so fast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”, looks like Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the garbled words of lorem ipsum bear an unmistakable resemblance to sections 1.10.32–33 of Cicero’s work, with the most notable passage excerpted below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\    “Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1914 English translation by Harris Rackham reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\    “Nor is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McClintock’s eye for detail certainly helped narrow the whereabouts of lorem ipsum’s origin, however, the “how and when” still remain something of a mystery, with competing theories and timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled part of Cicero’s De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a type specimen book.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lorem Ipsum]]></title><description><![CDATA[is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad

didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and

&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a

How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here’s a great quote from this Wikipedia on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg&quot;&gt;salted duck eggs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
